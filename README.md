## Introduction

Cooking is both an art and a science, and there are many factors that contribute to a recipe's success. One of these factors is the complexity of the recipe, which can be influenced by the number of ingredients, the amount of preparation time, and the level of difficulty in the cooking process. Another factor that can influence a recipe's success is the rating it receives from those who have tried it.

In this project, we will explore the relationship between the complexity of a recipe and the rating it receives. To do this, we will first need to perform data cleaning to ensure that our dataset is free of any errors. We will then assess missing data to determine whether it could affect our results , and if so, how to best address this issue. Finally, we will perform hypothesis testing to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between the complexity of a recipe and its rating.

By analyzing the data in this way, we hope to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to a recipe's success and provide valuable insights for both home cooks and professional chefs alike.
